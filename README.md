# Return Launchpad

A modern, open-source application launcher for macOS that brings back the classic Launchpad functionality removed in macOS Sequoia (Tahoe). Built with SwiftUI for macOS 15.5+.

## 🎯 Purpose

Apple removed the traditional Launchpad from macOS Sequoia, leaving users without a familiar way to browse and launch their applications in a grid view. Return Launchpad restores this functionality with modern enhancements and improvements.

## ✨ Features

- **Full-Screen Grid View**: Clean, organized display of all your applications
- **Smart Search**: Real-time filtering as you type
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of applications
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth animations and visual feedback
- **Centered Results**: Filtered search results are perfectly centered
- **One-Click Launch**: Click any app to launch it instantly
- **Auto-Close**: Launcher closes automatically after launching an app
- **Floating Window**: Appears above all other windows
- **Blur Background**: Native macOS visual effects for a polished look
